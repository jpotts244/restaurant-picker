## Restaurant Picker App

### Description
Small sinatra app that picks a restaurant at random when a user provides a location and cuisine, still very much a work in progress :-)

### Technologies Used
- Made with Ruby, Sinatra, JQuery, Yelp API, and Love

### Future Plans for Improvements
- Build out designed user interface
- Refector backend requests to Yelp API
- Organize Yelp app configurations and move them to their own `config/` directory
